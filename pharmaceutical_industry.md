# Pharmaceutical Industry
## Difference of Prescription and OTC drugs
* _prescription drugs_
  Are those dispensed to the public by a licensed pharmacist upon the written
  order (prescription) of a licensed doctor, dentist, or veterinarian and
  include drugs deemed to be unsafe to be used indiscriminately.
* _over-the-counter drugs_
  Are those offered by the pharmacist without the need for a prescription.
## Difficulty of developing new drugs
It takes about 7 years to rigorously test a drug and these tests costs roughly
about \$7 to \$8 million. Not to mention the patent to secure the drug only
lasts for about 17 years. Leaving only about 10 years to recover the money and
earn more.
## Impact in the food industry
The use of vitamins, antibiotics, and steroids in the animal and poultry feeds
has greatly increased the amount of meat produced per unit of feed fed.
## Natural and Synthetic
In the early days, most pharmaceutical products are from natural
sources so many technologies regarding the extraction of the important
chemicals were already developed. Some synthetic counterparts of these
naturally derived pharmaceuticals were also developed.

The advantage of developing ways to synthetically produce these natural
compounds is to meet the demand. Sometimes the natural supply does not meet
the demand.
## Purity standards
In the pharmaceutical industry, it is a great deal that the produce are as pure
as possible. Some standards were developed such as the U.S. Pharmacopeia
abbreviated as USP and National Formulary abbreviated as NF.
## Alkylation
### Phenobarbital USP
_5-ethyl-5-phenylbarbituric acid_
1. Nucleophilic substitution of Benzyl chloride and sodium cyanide followed by
   acid hydrolysis of the intermediary Benzyl cyanide in the presence of
   ethanol to produce Ethylphenylacetate.
2. It is then condensed with ethyl oxalate in the presence of ethanol and
   sodium to produce Diethyl sodium phenyloxaloacetate.
3. It is then reacted with hydrochloric acid and distilled at 180 degrees
   Celsius to produce a Diethyl ester of phenylmalonic acid.
4. It is then reacted with sodium and ethyl chloride to produce a Diethyl ester
   of phenylethylmalonic acid.
5. It is then condensed with urea to form the product Phenobarbital.
### Barbital
_diethylbarbituric acid_
1. Chloroacetic acid is reacted with sodium hydroxide to produce sodium
   chloroacetate.
2. It is then reacted with sodium cyanide in a boiling solution to produce 
   sodium cyanoacetate.
3. It is then reacted with ethanol and hydrochloric acid in benzene to produce
   diethyl malonate and ammonium sodium sulfate.
4. It is then reacted with sodium ethoxide to produce sodio malonic ester.
5. Then it is reacted with chloroethane in 700 kPa to produce ethylmalonic
   acid.
6. It is then reacted with sodium ethoxide and then with chloroethane at 700
   kPa to produce diethyl ester of diethylmalonic acid.
7. Then it is condensed with urea and sodium ethoxide to produce Barbital.
### Procaine Hydrochloride USP
_novocaine_
1. Alkylating ethylenechlorohydrin with diethylamine
2. Condensed with p-nitrobenzoyl chloride
3. Reduced with tin and hydrochloric acid to obtain procaine.
### Codeine NF and Codeine Phosphate USP
Codeine is an opiate (naturally extracted from the opium plant). It can be
synthesized from another opiate called morphine.

This synthesis is a directed alkylation of morphine to the phenolic hydroxyl.

1. Morphine is reacted with phenyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (a quaternary
   nitrogen alkylating agent) in the presence of potassium ethoxide in a
   reaction media of absolute alcohol. The dimethyl aniline and solvents are
   recovered and reused.
### Caffeine USP, Theobromine NF, and Theophylline NF
