# Pharmaceutical Industry
## Difference of Prescription and OTC drugs
* _prescription drugs_
  Are those dispensed to the public by a licensed pharmacist upon the written
  order (prescription) of a licensed doctor, dentist, or veterinarian and
  include drugs deemed to be unsafe to be used indiscriminately.
* _over-the-counter drugs_
  Are those offered by the pharmacist without the need for a prescription.
## Difficulty of developing new drugs
It takes about 7 years to rigorously test a drug and these tests costs roughly
about \$7 to \$8 million. Not to mention the patent to secure the drug only
lasts for about 17 years. Leaving only about 10 years to recover the money and
earn more.
## Impact in the food industry
The use of vitamins, antibiotics, and steroids in the animal and poultry feeds
has greatly increased the amount of meat produced per unit of feed fed.
